## Build the demo using Android Studio

### Prerequisites

*   If you don't have already, install
    **[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)**,
    following the instructions on the website.

*   You need an Android device and Android development environment with minimum
    API 21.

### Building

*   Open Android Studio, and from the Welcome screen, select Open an existing
    Android Studio project.

*   From the Open File or Project window that appears, navigate to and select
    the tensorflow-lite/examples/object_detection/android directory from
    wherever you cloned the TensorFlow Lite sample GitHub repo. Click OK.

*   If it asks you to do a Gradle Sync, click OK.

*   You may also need to install various platforms and tools, if you get errors
    like "Failed to find target with hash string 'android-21'" and similar.
    Click the `Run` button (the green arrow) or select `Run > Run 'android'`
